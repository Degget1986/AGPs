# AGP-130: Aragon Mesh Sponsorship

### Summary

Aragon Mesh started as a [Nest project](https://github.com/aragon/nest/pull/151) to fund the development of the aragonCLI. To manage the grant funds we implemented a milestone-based process inspired by [Giveth](https://giveth.io), where contributors would summarize their work over a given period alongside a reasonable pay rate and the other DAO members would vote whether to approve their compensation. We think this process is low-overhead and fits the DAO very well at this stage.

Our mission is to improve the developer experience as a whole, which includes easing the on-boarding process of new developers that wish to work on the Aragon core infrastructure & SDK. This AGP aims to compensate those devs.

In this new endeavor we are looking forward to formalizing and improving the current process. We have been keeping track of milestones in this GitHub repository: [AragonMesh/team](https://github.com/AragonMesh/team). As part of improving the current process we would like to continue experimenting with the [Projects app](https://github.com/AutarkLabs/open-enterprise/blob/dev/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md#install-the-projects-app) of the Open Enterprise suite and bounty-based compensation.

Aaragon One will be leading the roadmap of the SDK to shape the future of the dev tooling. It will be responsible for doing the research needed and experiment with new technologies. Mesh will fund devs contributing to the SDK roadmap. An onboarding process will be in place and members will be part of the SDK Working Group. We welcome every developer to add milestones on the Mesh DAO if their work was SDK related.
