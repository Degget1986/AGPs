## Purpose of the transfer

When the last AGP occured, Aragon Black renounced running for Flock due to some uncertainties regarding the Flock process itself. We are now working on a more self-sustainable path to support our team effort in the mid-term. Though, the fundraising app needs maintenance in _the short-term_.

The goal of this grant is to support the maintenance of the Fundraising app during the next three months \[and reward the off-Flock work that occurred during November to release fundraising to mainnet]. The main initiatives to be funded by that grant are:

* **Mainnet release.** The Fundraising app is currently being polished both contract-wise and frontend-wise to be published to mainnet.

* **Frontend maintenance.** As with any new complex app we can expect some frontend bugs that would need to be fixed once Fundraising is published to mainnet.

* **Technical feedback.** Lots of [potential] users are currently asking for technical feedback or feasibility studies about potential features implementation.

We expect these tasks to require a weekly 35 men-hour effort [_i.e._ 1.5 days of weekly work for each of our three dev members] over the next 3 months [with an average payroll of $60 / hour leading to a $25,000 grant] and ask an extra $5000 to account for the work done prior to that grant [leading to a total $30,000 grant].

We also ask for a 20k ANT package to acknowledge Fundraising's contribution to ANT value and allow us to experiment with ANT / DAI arbitrage as a sustainability mechanism for our team.
