## Motivation for making this change

In the past year that the Aragon Governance Proposal Process has been in use, we have had five official votes. At the Aragon Association, we have learned from observing and participating in these votes and are now applying these learnings to inform the future evolution of Aragon Network governance. 

We have identified several benefits of the AGP process, such as:

- The process gave a way for the community to “dogfood” using Aragon governance tools and incorporate those experiences into our product-development process.

- Although very early stages in terms of its maturity, having an on-chain governance process with a relatively low barrier to participation was a source of excitement in the community and brought attention to the project as one of the first examples of DAO tools working on Ethereum mainnet.

- The Aragon Association got a chance to learn about what’s important to the community; by and large this was funding further development of the Aragon platform and fostering an ecosystem of tools built on Aragon.

We have also identified some shortcomings of the current process, such as:

- The vast majority of ANT holders have not felt that participating in the AGP process in any way is worth it to them (either by writing proposals, participating in discussions and publicly evaluating proposals, or voting on proposals). This is evidenced by their inaction during each of the votes that has occurred: while there are over 20,000 Ethereum accounts that hold ANT, no vote has seen more than 70 unique accounts or ~10% of the ANT supply participate. While there’s nothing inherently wrong with low turnout, we would like to find ways to increase participation in case even better ideas than have already been presented are out there waiting to be brought into the conversation.

- Of those who do participate in votes, we have heard feedback that voters do not have enough information to make a fully informed decision. The lack of delegated voting means that voters either participate with incomplete information or don’t participate at all. Either outcome is sub-optimal.

- ANT holders have voted to spend money with little due diligence or restraint and continue adding obligations and responsibilities to the Aragon Association, despite the limited resources the Association has to cope with these increasing demands. Most proposals have very little discussion around them, and yet most proposals are also approved, leaving the bulk of due diligence responsibility on the Association. This is unsustainable.

- The Aragon Network currently inherits the legal constraints of the Aragon Association, since the Association is responsible for executing the decisions made by ANT holders in AGP votes. Vice versa, the Association cannot act with legitimacy without first having major decisions approved by the Network; this sometimes results in a painful lag in decision-making due to the voting schedule of the Network.

We would like to take advantage of the opportunity presented by the mainnet launch of the Aragon Network DAO to revisit some past decisions we have made about how Aragon Network governance works, with an eye toward preserving the benefits while improving the areas where the process falls short. In particular, we believe that by separating powers and concerns in Aragon Network governance, we can both empower ANT holders with control over the destiny of the Aragon Network, as envisioned since the beginning of the project, and give the Aragon Association the flexibility it needs to rapidly adjust course depending on current priorities and market conditions.

If approved, this proposal will sunset the current governance process as defined in AGP-1. In Phase 3 of the Aragon Network launch process, control of the Aragon Network DAO will be turned over from the initial governance council to ANT holders. ANT holders will then be able to vote on whether or not to adopt an Aragon Agreement that will define Aragon Network governance from then on. At that point we will also be able to experiment with new ways of solving problems around voter participation and proposal due diligence in the design of the new governance processes that will be adopted along with the Aragon Network Agreement.

Going forward, the Aragon Association will take responsibility for making decisions about its day-to-day operations as well as long-term treasury management. While product development has dominated priorities since the project was announced to the world in 2017, the Association has now made adoption of Aragon and related products its #1 priority and plans to focus resources toward that end.

The Aragon Association would like to thank everyone who has participated in Aragon Network governance experiments so far. We look forward to further collaboration with you as the process evolves. There is still much work to do and we need all the help we can get!
